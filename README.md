## Welcome

collections-ts is a project inspired by collections-js, which has entered 
un-maintained mode.

This project aims to provide an agnostic library of Java Collections. 
You will find most of the implementations here are like Java JDK.

## Why choose this over collections-js

Well, mainly 2 reasons.

1. collections-js is no more maintained and there are a number of data structures 
missing, e.g. TreeMap, BST, BBST etc.
2. collections-ts, on the other hand, is strictly OOP and type-scripted. 
As long as the user land pass in a correct type. We'll aim to check as much as 
possible at compilation time.
