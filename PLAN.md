## Plans

"DFS" approach: we'll try to implement one DS to a workable state and move onto the next. You can find a list of next DS plans here.

### v0.0.X - Priority Queue (Heap)

- interfaces
- implementations
- typing
- testing


### v0.1.X - TreeMap (in Red-black Tree)

- (build from blank) Add, delete, get
- test
- build from map
- build from sorted map (putAll, )

### Milestone N

### Milestone N+1

- benchmark
