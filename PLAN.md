## Plans

"DFS" approach: we'll try to implement one DS to a workable state and move onto the next. You can find a list of next DS plans here.

### Milestone 1 - Priority Queue (Heap)

- interfaces
- implementations
- typing
- testing


### Milestone 2 - TreeMap (in Red-black Tree)

### Milestone N

### Milestone N+1

- benchmark
